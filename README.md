# Secure HRFlow DBT Project ðŸš€

## Overview  
This project showcases a secure and scalable way to manage and transform employee attrition data using modern DataOps practices.

Employee data is one of the most sensitive and valuable assets a company has. Handling it with care isnâ€™t just good practice â€” itâ€™s essential for protecting privacy, complying with regulations, and making smart business decisions. ðŸ”’

## Why Employee Data Matters  
- **Privacy & Compliance:** Employee records often contain personal info that must be safeguarded under laws like GDPR or HIPAA. Getting this wrong risks legal trouble and trust.  
- **Business Insights:** Understanding why employees leave helps companies improve retention and build stronger teams.  
- **Data Integrity:** Clean, accurate data means decisions are based on facts â€” not guesswork.

## Tools Used  
- **dbt** for modular, maintainable SQL transformations and testing  
- **Azure Data Factory** to orchestrate and automate data ingestion  
- **Azure Blob Storage** for secure raw data storage  
- **Azure SQL Database** as the data warehouse for transformed data  
- **Azure Key Vault** to securely manage credentials and secrets  

## Project Goals  
- Build a reliable data pipeline that securely ingests, cleanses, and transforms HR data.  
- Use dbt to organize transformations and enforce data quality.  
- Share best practices for safe, scalable employee data management.

## Repository Structure  
This repo includes all the core pieces â€” models, seed data, macros, and docs â€” plus helpful screenshots and assets showing the pipeline in action.

## Final Thoughts  
Handling employee data responsibly is about more than tech â€” itâ€™s about trust, ethics, and compliance. This project is a step toward better, safer HR analytics for any business. ðŸ’¼âœ¨
